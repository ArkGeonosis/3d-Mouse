# 3d-Mouse
Using capacitive sensing, you can measure the distance of an object, using this I will create a 3d tracker and use it as a 3d mouse for using with various 3d environments.

The video linked below gave me this idea, I want to use the same idea, and apply it to 3d enviornments such as autocad or 123d design.
